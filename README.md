# Project With Auth Boilerplate

Created this so I can have a quick starting off point for future projects. Here we are using Angular 9 with Routing and Firebase for the back end.

## How to use
1. Fork this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Create a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project
4. Update `/src/environments/environment.ts` with the correct details
    1. Little tip: If you want to ensure you don't commit your API Key run the following command `git update-index --assume-unchanged src/environments/environment.ts`
5. `ng serve` to run the local server.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
